- **Homework Assignments (40%)** :
  There will be *six* programming assignments,
  assigned every one or two weeks.
  Instructions on turning them in will be posted with
  each assignment.
  
    - You will work on the assignment *in groups of two*;
      we will assign you a partner randomly at the beginning of the quarter.
      *Every student* has to turn in their solution,
      even if their solution is identical to their partner's.
      
    - You have a total of *eight late days*
      that you can use throughout the quarter,
      but no more than *four late days* per assignment.
      A late day means anything between 1 second and 23
      hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline.
      
- **Midterm (25%)** :
  Will be held on **Monday May 4**.
  The format will be announced before the midterm.

- **Final (30%)** :
  Will be held on **Friday June 12**.
  The format will be announced before the final.
  
    - Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will be calculated as 
      `midterm > 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0`.
      This means that you get a second chance if you donâ€™t do well on the midterm but 
      you must turn in both the midterm and the final.

- **Discussions (5%)** : 
  Extra credit for top-20 best participants in Canvas discussions,
  determined by the instruction team.
